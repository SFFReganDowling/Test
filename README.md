# Weather Clock
Displays the weather forecast for the upcoming 12 (11?) hours for the current
location on a clock face.

It shows temperature where ordinary clocks show hour numbers.

# TODO
* Display an SVG clock face.
* Demonstrate setting temperature numbers at the different hour positions from Javascript.
* Download weather for hard coded location.
* Put temperature numbers on clock face
* Draw clock hands
* Put weather symbols on the clock face, between the temperatures and the clock center, but much closer to the temperatures.
* Draw precipitation from the center out. Basically a radial version of what yr.no is doing in their weather graph.
* Use the current location
* Somehow figure out location name and put it on the clock face just below the center, kind of where the brand could be on an actual clock.
